# DevOps

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **DevOps lab setup** that includes deploying a simple **Django web application** connected to a **MySQL database**.
The web application runs on **NGINX** as a reverse proxy, and all code is version-controlled with **Git** and pushed to **GitHub** using a Personal Access Token (PAT).

The goal of the lab was to simulate a realistic multi-server DevOps environment and practice deployment, configuration, and version control skills.
